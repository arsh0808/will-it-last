You are just the right amount of crazy
(dont judge too soon)
painted on the canvas of immense beauty
with the colors oh so bright
of jokes and joy
and it flows
to the darker shades
(mera baby poetâ™‹)
like the stormy grey skies of the deep blue
your anger, like the tempest
rocking my world
and the sun shines again
the bright yellow of your love
shining upon me
as i gaze into canvas of your soul
the eyes, seeing the painting come to life.
